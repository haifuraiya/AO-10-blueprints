Quiz for fans of the AMSAT Phase IIIB/AO-10 blueprints
Phil Karn, KA9Q

Question 1: AO-10 carried a 400-newton kick (rocket) motor that used hypergolic propellants. It was fired only once, but the burn duration was 1.68 times longer than planned. Why? (Note: the burn did *not* end because of propellant depletion.)

The cause can be discerned from the prints; i.e., it was a hardware problem, not a software bug or operational mistake.

Optional hint 1: The burn was timed in hardware.

Question 2: The ground test of the hardware consisted of successfully executing a maximal length burn. What tests could have revealed it?

Question 3: Although the first burn did not deplete the propellants, it was not possible to fire the engine again because of insufficient helium pressure. Why? (Hint: the cause was not insufficient helium loading before launch.)
